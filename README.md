## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Neeraja R**, a **Biomedical Engineer** passionate about applying **computer vision and deep learning** to solve medical imaging challenges.  

Iâ€™ve been part of the **IGRSâ€“Medical Imaging** team at HTIC, where our goal was to develop **robotic systems for Image-Guided Surgeries**.  
As a researcher and developer, I worked on multiple computer vision tasks focused on **3D reconstruction, registration and segmentation**.

I was one of the main contributors to the following research repositories:

- [**3D-ReVert**](https://github.com/IGRS-medical-imaging/3D-ReVert) â€” *MLMI, MICCAI 2025*  
  *3D surface reconstruction of vertebrae from a single image*

- [**Rad-Surf**](https://github.com/IGRS-medical-imaging/RadSurf) â€” *DEMI, MICCAI 2025*  
  *Automated dataset generation for single-view reconstruction*

- [**SpineStyle**](https://github.com/IGRS-medical-imaging/Spine-Style) â€” *MLMI, MICCAI 2024*  
  *Domain-adaptive style transfer for spinal CT and digitally reconstructed radiographs*
